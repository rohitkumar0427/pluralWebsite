    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A symbol or name that stands for a value.</li>
        <li>A variable is a value that can change.</li>
        <li>Variables provide temporary storage for information
            that will be needed during the lifespan of the
            computer program (or application).</li>
       <li>Variables store everything in your program.</li>
       <li>The purpose of any useful program is to modify
        variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <p>z = x + y</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an example of programming expression.</li>
        <li>x, y and z are variables.</li>
        <li> Variables can represent numeric values, characters,
            character strings, or memory addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

        <h1>Types of Variable</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Local variable</li>
            <li> Global variable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
 <div>
     <h1>Types of Variable</h1>
     <li>Local variables are those that are in scope within a
        specific part of the program (function, procedure,
        method, or subroutine, depending on the
        programming language employed). </li>
        <li> Global variables are those that are in scope for the
            duration of the programs execution. They can be
            accessed by any part of the program, and are readwrite for all statements that access them.</li>
 </div>
 <div>
     <h1>Rules in Naming a Variable</h1>
     <li>They are</li>
       <li> â€“ It should use only alphabets, number and
            underscore ( _ )</li> 
            <li>   It should not begin with a number and must have at
                least one alphabet</li> 
                <li>  It should not be a reserved word</li> 
    
     
 </div>
 <div>
     <h1>Constants</h1>
     <li>The opposite of a variable is a constant.</li>
     <li>A constant is a value that never changes.</li>
     <li>Because of their inflexibility, constants are used less
        often than variables in programming.</li>
